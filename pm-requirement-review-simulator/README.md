# PM Requirement Review Simulator

[中文版](README-zh.md)

> Stress-test your product requirements before the real meeting. Five cross-functional roles challenge your PRD with realistic pushback — outputs a scored HTML survival report.

## What It Does

Describe your product requirement and choose a difficulty level. The agent simulates a **cross-functional review meeting** where 5 roles — Engineering, Operations, Design, Executive, and Legal — each challenge your PRD with role-specific concerns and speaking styles. It then generates a **light-blue themed HTML report** (light-blue hero + white cards + SVG gauge & radar) with:

- **Survival Score** — deterministic scoring engine (per-item 0/1/2 weighted formula), not vibes
- **5-Dimension Radar Chart** — visual breakdown of strengths and fatal weaknesses
- **Decision Gates** — value / risk / resource / strategy gates with A/B/C option comparison
- **Counterargument Playbook** — TOP 3 hardest questions with "normal reply" vs "killer reply" + technique breakdown
- **RACI Matrix** — cross-team collaboration plan with conflict identification and resolution
- **Meeting Script** — ready-to-use opening, core argument, risk mitigation, decision, wrap-up
- **Action Checklist** — owner + deadline + deliverable + review checkpoint

## Difficulty Levels

| Level | Style | Best For |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 🟢 Rookie | Gentle suggestions, constructive tone | New PMs, first-time practice |
| 🟡 Realistic | Standard big-tech review intensity | Pre-meeting dry run |
| 🔴 Hell Mode | All hostile + industry jargon attacks | Senior PMs stress-testing edge cases |

## Quick Start

```text
Review my team's group-buying feature. Realistic mode.
```

The agent will output an **info collection checklist** first (goal, scope, constraints, etc.), then generate the full report after confirmation.

```

1. **Input**: identify requirement type (major feature / tool / MVP / iteration / compliance) + PRD source
2. **Processing**: 5 roles challenge by persona, per-item scoring, weight normalization, survival rate
3. **Output**: generate 11-section HTML report (light-blue theme)
